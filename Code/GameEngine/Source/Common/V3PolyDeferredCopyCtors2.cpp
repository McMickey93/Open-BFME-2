// Copy constructors split from V3PolyDeferredCopyCtors.cpp. Neither class has a
// virtual destructor: each copy ctor installs a one-slot retail vftable whose
// slot is the record's transfer method, not a deleting destructor (target
// facts). 0x0028C62B stores 0x007F91FC, the table the default ctor 0x00263653
// stores (slot 0x004D6FC4), so both are Rva00263653's. 0x0028F68F stores
// 0x007F9200, the table the default ctor 0x00263895 stores (slot 0x004D6F86),
// so both are Rva00263895Member's. Its +0x04 member is the 0x0028C62B class
// and its +0x6C member the 0x0028C6D6 class, which matches the default ctor's
// layout.
